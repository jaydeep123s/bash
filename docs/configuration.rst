Configuration
=================

In order to be suitable for a variety of projects, a lot of configurations can be applied. This page should give you an overview of what is possible and where to change it.


Environment variables
-------------------------
We use environment variables for:

* Configuration

  * choosing a mapview backend that delivers the map tiles (square pngs of the map at a certain zoom level) to the user. For more technical information, refer to :ref:`architecture:mapview`.

* Credentials

  * sendgrid key (if you use sendgrid as the mail service) (See :ref:`architecture:mail-setup`)
  * mapbox token (if you use mapbox as a tile server) (See :ref:`architecture:mapview`)
